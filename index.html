<p class = "pAbout">They're cookies made with salmon and shaped like salmon, too! We only
  use the finest organic, cage free, wild caught salmon. The fish is ground up so fine
  that you can't even taste it, but you'll get all the benefits! These cookies are the
  ideal match for a steaming cup of coffee on a gray Seattle morning... Or gray Seattle
  afternoon... Or gray Seattle evening. Tourists will love them, and you locals will
  begrudgingly fall in love with them.</p>
