      <p class = "pAbout">They're cookies made with salmon and shaped like salmon, too! We only
        use the finest organic, cage free, wild caught salmon. The fish is ground up so fine
        that you can't even taste it, but you'll get all the benefits! These cookies are the
        ideal match for a steaming cup of coffee on a gray Seattle morning... Or gray Seattle
        afternoon... Or gray Seattle evening. Tourists will love them, and you locals will
        begrudgingly fall in love with them, too.</p>
